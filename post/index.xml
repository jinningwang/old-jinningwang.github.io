      <title>Fix Power Flow and TDS Initialization Error in ANDES</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/andes_init_debug/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As dsicussed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cuihantao/andes/discussions/386&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANDES Discussions #386&lt;/a&gt;, the user may run into &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;power flow divergence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TDS initialization error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; when revising cases file from given cases. In this blog, we will discuss how to fix these errors. The case files and source code can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jinningwang/jinningwang/tree/main/blogs/andes_init_debug&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;andes_init_debug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;power-flow-divergence&#34;&gt;Power flow divergence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AC power flow resutls are used as the initialization points of TDS. In ANDES, devices &lt;code&gt;Bus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PQ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Slack&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Shunt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Line&lt;/code&gt; are used to solve AC power flow. Usually, the user may revise the system topology, such as adding new devices (&lt;code&gt;Bus&lt;/code&gt;) or changing load (&lt;code&gt;PQ&lt;/code&gt;). Belows are some possible reasons for failed power flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power load unbalance is too large;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bus initial voltage and angle are inapproriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tds-initialization-error&#34;&gt;TDS initialization error&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After solving the AC power flow, the dynamic device can be initialized from the power flow results. Belows list some possible reasons for failed TDS initialization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inapproriate limiter values, usually occurs in &lt;code&gt;TurbineGov&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exciter&lt;/code&gt; if power flow is changed significantly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inapproriate dynamic devcie parameters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inapproriate equations in dynamic model, usually happens when developing new models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Novelty in Science</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/novelty/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/novelty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I see reviewers regularly mistake complexity, difficulty, and technicality for novelty. In science reviewing, novelty seems to imply these things. We might be better served by removing the word “novelty” from the review instructions and replacing it with &lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauty removes the notions of “technical” and “complex” and gets more to the heart of scientific novelty. A painting can be beautiful even if it is simple and the technical complexity is low. So can a paper. A little squiggle of paint by Picasso can be as beautiful as an intricate painting by Rembrandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping beauty in mind, let’s look at some common reviewer misunderstandings about novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-complexity&#34;&gt;Novelty as complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of an idea is often confused with a lack of novelty when exactly the opposite is often true. A common review critique is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea is very simple. It just changes one term in the loss and everything else is the same as prior work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nobody thought to change that one term, then it is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipso facto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; novel. The inventive insight is to realize that a small change could have a big effect and to formulate the new loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such reviews lead my students to say that we should make an idea appear more complex so that reviewers will find it of higher value. I value simplicity over unnecessary complexity; the simpler the better. Taking an existing network and replacing one thing is better science than concocting a whole new network just to make it look more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-difficulty&#34;&gt;Novelty as difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to get a paper into a top conference, therefore reviewers often feel that the ideas and technical details must be difficult. The authors have to shed blood, sweat, and tears to deserve a paper. Inexperienced reviewers, in particular, like to see that the authors have really worked hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formulating a simple idea means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core of something. This is one of the most useful things that a scientist can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple idea can be important. But it can also be trivial. This is where reviewers struggle. A trivial idea is an unimportant idea. If a paper has a simple idea that works better than the state of the art, then it is most likely not trivial. The authors are onto something and the field will be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-surprise&#34;&gt;Novelty as surprise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty and surprise are closely related. A novel idea is a surprising one by definition — it’s one that nobody in the field thought of. But there is a flip side to this as surprise is a fleeting emotion. If you hear a good idea, there is a moment of surprise and then, the better it is, the more obvious it may seem. A common review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea is obvious because the authors just combined two well known ideas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious is the opposite of novelty. So, if an idea is obvious &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve heard it, reviewers quickly assume it isn’t novel. The novelty, however, must be evaluated &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the idea existed. The inventive novelty was to have the idea in the first place. If it is easy to explain and obvious in hindsight, this in no way diminishes the creativity (and novelty) of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-technical-novelty&#34;&gt;Novelty as technical novelty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common misconception of reviewers is that novelty pertains to technical details. Novelty (and value) come in many forms in papers. A new dataset can be novel if it does something no other dataset has done, even if all the methods used to generate the dataset are well known. A new use of an old method can be novel if nobody ever thought to use it this way. Replacing a complex algorithm with a simple one provides insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty reveals itself in as many ways as beauty. Before critiquing a paper for a lack to technical novelty ask yourself if the true novelty lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-usefulness-or-value&#34;&gt;Novelty as usefulness or value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all novel ideas are useful. Just the property of being new does not connote value. We want new ideas that lead us somewhere. Here, reviewers need to be very careful. It’s very hard to know where a new idea will take the field because any predictions that we make are based on the field as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common review I get is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors describe a new method but I don’t know why anyone needs this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of utility is indeed an issue but it is very hard to assess with a new idea. Reviewers should be careful here and aware that we all have limited imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-personal-note&#34;&gt;A personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My early career was built on seeing and formalizing connections between two established fields: robust statistics and Markov random fields. The novelty arose from the fact that nobody had put these ideas together before. It turned out to be a fertile space with many surprising connections that led to new theory. Fortunately, these connections also turned out to be valuable, resulting in practical algorithms that were state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hindsight, the connection between robust statistics and outliers in computer vision seems obvious. Today, the use of robust estimators in vision is the norm and seems no more novel than breathing air. But to see the connections for the first time, before others saw them, was like breathing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little in life more exciting than that spark of realization in science when you glimpse a new way of seeing. You feel as if you were the first to stand on a mountain peak. You are seeing the world for a moment the way nobody before you has ever seen it. This is novelty and it happens in an instant but is enabled by all of one’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting paper embodies the translation of the idea into code, experiments, and text. In this translation, the beauty of the spark may be only dimly glimpsed. My request of reviewers is to try to imagine the darkness before the spark.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model Development Workflow in ADNES</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/andes_dev/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/andes_dev/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on my personal development experience, I summarized this guide as a clue for those who want to try ANDES and develop models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-andes&#34;&gt;What is ANDES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANDES&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source Python library for power system modeling and simulation developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cui.eecps.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Hantao Cui&lt;/a&gt;. ANDES allows users to develop new models by their own will, which can be easily done by translating block diagrams into models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of ANDES is introduced in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. Cui, F. Li and K. Tomsovic, &amp;ldquo;Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric Framework for Power System Modeling and Analysis,&amp;rdquo; in  &lt;em&gt;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems&lt;/em&gt; , vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 1373-1384, March 2021, doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3017019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDES is currently under &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; development and maintenance by Dr. Hantao Cui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-develop-new-model-with-andes&#34;&gt;How to develop new model with ANDES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples for development new models are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/modeling/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before developing a new model, it is recommended to go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/modelref.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Model reference&lt;/a&gt; and check out the existing groups and their functions. Then the following steps can be followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have installed ANDES in development mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check existing models that are similar to your model, and then draft the diagram of your model. Some standard model references are available on ESIG, Neplan, PowerWorld, and PSSE Model Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When implementing the model, similar function pieces from existing models can help to reduce manual efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your model and finalize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-generate the pycode by &lt;code&gt;andes prep&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes there occur multi-functionalities, where you may need &lt;code&gt;andes prep -f&lt;/code&gt; to re-generate all model codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a test case file that includes your model, where the IEEE 14-bus system and Kundur system can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the test case, and run the &lt;code&gt;ss.TDS.init()&lt;/code&gt; to see if the initialization is successful. If initialization runs into an error, you may need to tune the model initialization equations (&lt;code&gt;v_str&lt;/code&gt; defined in the model). Remember to run &lt;code&gt;andes prep&lt;/code&gt; and restart the kernel (for Jupyter Notebook users) every time you make a change to the model code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finishing the model development, it is encouraged to check the code style (can be done by package flake8) and open a PR to contribute it into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cuihantao/andes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ADNES repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
