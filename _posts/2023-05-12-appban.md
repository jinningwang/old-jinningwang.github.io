## University provided details regarding Tennessee Law SB 0834 (HB 1445) a.k.a. Tik Tok Ban Law

On **December 6**, in response to Jinning's request, the [Center for Global Engagement][CGE] provided details regarding Tennessee Law SB 0834 (HB 1445), also known as the TikTok Ban Law. This information is available at [Details regarding Tennessee Law -SB 0834/ HB 1445 A.K.A “Tik Tok Ban Law”][CGE Details].

In the detailed second and third points, UTK clarified that it was the State of Tennessee, not the University of Tennessee, that created the law. Additionally, UTK claimed that the state legislation does not provide an exhaustive list of applications; the names mentioned are examples of known applications that are Chinese owned and operated.

However, these details did not clearly answer the question of ***HOW*** those apps were determined to be "known applications" for a "social media platform" and ***WHO*** made these determinations.

Jinning has tried to reach out to the campus leaders for further clarification.

## Campus Leaders' Meeting with the University Members

![Meeting Photo](/images/poster/meeting.jpg)
Campus Leaders' Meeting.

Contact Jinning Wang at jwang175@vols.utk.edu if any copyright concerns.

On **November 5**, [Chancellor Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] and her [Cabinet][Cabinet] met with the invited university members to discuss the Tik Tok ban.

At the beginning, attendees explored potential alternative apps and technologies that could be of assistance. Unfortunately, the discussion did not lead to any meaningful conclusions.

Subsequently, campus leaders introduced their ongoing pilot project aimed at helping the impacted community stay in touch with their families and friends in China. This project is expected to take a couple of weeks to complete preliminary test.

One suggestion from the students during the meeting was to consider providing financial support to the affected community as a means of mitigating the ban's impact.
However, campus leaders expressed concerns about whether university funding could be utilized in this manner.

Additionally, Jinning Wang wondered a justification for the list of banned apps, as he had been advocating for this since the beginning.
The campus leaders explained that both WeChat and TikTok had been explicitly mentioned during the legislative discussion, while other apps were added based on conventions followed by other institutions.

In the end, Jinning Wang made two requests of the university: 1) A written report detailing the university's involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection; 2) An email from the university expressing apologies to the impacted community for the lack of communication and demonstrating their support for the affected members.

The campus leaders agreed to comply with both requests.

## CFAAPI meeting with the Chancellor Donde Plowman and her leadership team

On **September 5**, [CFAAPI][CFAAPI] leaders were invited to meet with the [Chancellor Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] and her leadership team. In this context, CFAAPI forwarded Jinning Wang's feedback to the campus leadership team.

Jinning Wang's letter is excerpted below, and he strongly advocates for the third mitigation measure, as he believes it will benefit the entire Volunteers:

Dear University of Tennessee Campus Leaders,

I would like to offer some suggestions regarding the recent Chinese app ban policy that has been implemented at our university.

In light of the Chinese app ban policy, our university faces several potential challenges that merit attention:

1. Compliance with State Government: As a subordinate institution to the state government, the university is obligated to follow government decisions, regardless of the decision's
   nature.
2. Lack of Awareness: Campus leaders may not be fully aware of the potential negative
   consequences associated with this policy.
3. Lack of Precedence: The university may not have encountered similar issues in the past,
   leading to uncertainty in handling this situation.
4. Lack of Appropriate Discussion with Impacted Communities: Adequate consultation and
   discussion with the communities affected by this policy may not have occurred, potentially leading to misunderstandings and concerns.

To address these challenges, I propose several mitigation measures:

1. Feedback Mechanism: To bridge the gap between the state government and the university's operational realities, establishing a feedback mechanism can help convey the challenges and complexities faced by our institution due to the app ban.
2. Task Force: Given the busy schedules of campus leaders, forming a dedicated task force comprising experts who can thoroughly analyze the policy's impact and potential alternatives could be more effective and practical.
3. Transparency through Reporting: Publish a comprehensive report detailing the timeline of the university's involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection. This report would provide valuable insights to all volunteers and help create a more balanced policy.
4. Suspending the Controversial Policy: Considering the potential negative impact and lack of convincing justification, it may be prudent to temporarily suspend the controversial policy until further convincing evidence or justifications are provided.

Your dedication to ensuring the best interests of the university and its community is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for considering these suggestions, and I look forward to seeing how we can collectively navigate this issue.

# 中国应用禁令在田纳西大学的进展

一个国际学生对中国应用禁令进展的观察：州立法、大学政策、以及在田纳西大学受影响的群体。

* [SB 0834提交](#sb-0834提交)

## 学校提供的详细信息

**12月6日**，作为对王晋宁的要求的回应，CGE 提供了有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息，也称为Tik Tok禁令法。这些信息可在[有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息][CGE Details]中查看。

在详细的第二和第三点中，UTK澄清，制定该法律的是田纳西州，而不是田纳西大学。此外，UTK声称，州立法并未提供应用程序的详尽列表；提到的名称只是已知的中国拥有和运营的应用程序的示例。

然而，这些细节并没有清楚地回答这样一个问题：对于“社媒平台”来说，***如何***确定这些应用是“已知应用”，以及***何人***做出这些决定。

王晋宁试图与校领导取得联系以获取进一步的澄清。

## 校领导与大学成员的会议

**11月5日**，校长 [Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] 及其[内阁][Cabinet]与受邀的大学成员会面，讨论 Tik Tok 禁令。

一开始，与会者探讨了可能有助于解决问题的潜在替代应用程序和技术。不幸的是，讨论没有达成任何有意义的结论。

随后，校领导介绍了他们正在进行的旨在帮助受影响社区与其在中国的家人和朋友保持联系的试点项目。该项目预计需要数周时间来完成初步测试。

与会期间，学生提出了一个建议，考虑提供财政支持来减轻禁令对受影响社区的影响。然而，校领导对于是否可以利用大学资金进行该项活动提出了担忧。

此外，王晋宁对被禁应用名单的选取提出疑问，一如该事件开始时那样。
校领导解释说，立法讨论中明确提到了 WeChat 和 TikTok，而其他应用是根据其他机构的惯例添加的。

最后，王晋宁提出了两项要求：1）提供一份详细说明大学在立法过程、内部讨论以及应用选择标准方面的明细；2）大学通过电子邮件向受影响社区表示道歉，表达对受影响成员的支持。

校领导同意满足这两项要求。

## CFAAPI与校长及其领导团队的会议

**9月5日**，[CFAAPI][CFAAPI] 领导受邀与校长 [Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] 及校领导团队会面。在此背景下，CFAAPI将王晋宁的反馈意见转交给了校领导团队。

王晋宁的信函如下节选，并且他坚持第三项弥补措施，因为他认为这将使全体志愿者受益：

尊敬的田纳西大学校领导：

我想就最近在我们大学实施的中国App禁令政策提出一些建议。

考虑到中国App禁令政策，我们大学面临一些需要关注的潜在挑战：

1. 遵守州政府法规：作为州政府的从属机构，大学有义务遵守政府的决定，无论其性质如何。
2. 缺乏认识：校园领导可能未能充分认识到与这一政策相关的潜在负面后果。
3. 缺乏先例：大学可能以前没有遇到类似的问题，这可能导致在处理这种情况时伴有不确定性。
4. 与受影响群体缺乏适当的讨论：可能尚未与受该政策影响的社区进行充分的咨询和讨论，这可能导致误解和担忧。

为解决这些挑战，我提出以下几项缓解措施：

1. 反馈机制：为了弥合州政府与大学实际运营之间的差距，建立反馈机制有助于传达由于App禁令而使我们单位面临的挑战和复杂性。
2. 工作组：鉴于校领导的繁忙工作日程，成立一个由专家组成的工作组，可以对政策的影响和潜在替代方案进行彻底分析，可能更加有效和切实可行。
3. 通过报告实现透明度：公开一份详尽的报告，详细描述大学参与立法过程的时间线，内部讨论以及App选择标准。这份报告将为所有志愿者提供有价值的见解，有助于制定更加平衡的政策。
4. 暂停有争议的政策：考虑到潜在的负面影响和缺乏令人信服的理由，暂时暂停有争议的政策可能是明智的，直到提供进一步令人信服的证据或理由。

感谢您致力于确保大学及其社区的权益。感谢您考虑这些建议，期待我们共同解决这个问题。

王晋宁
