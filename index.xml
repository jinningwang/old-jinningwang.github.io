  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig1.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.1 COVID-19 incidence map. COVID-19 Incidence map of 380 metropolitan statistical areas in the continental U.S. during April-May 2020.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the COVID-19 incidence map of the 380 MSAs in the continental U.S. during the two-month window from April to May 2020. The COVID-19 incidence of MSAs are calculated and plot on the map from U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic situation on the west coast (e.g., the states of Washington, Oregon, and California) was low to medium, and the situation along the southeastern coast (e.g., the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida) was medium. However, states along the northeastern coast were experiencing high-to-critical levels of COVID-19 incidence. The largest critical area was the MSA of New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA, which encompasses 20 million people. Along the northeastern coast, there were two other MSAs at critical incidence levels: Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ and Salisbury, MD-DE. The incidence level map shows geographical relevance among these areas since the adjacent MSAs to New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA also experienced a high incidence of COVID-19 at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-fig2-cluster-centers-of-msa-economic-structure-the-length-of-each-colored-bar-represents-the-gdp-percentage-of-the-corresponding-economic-category&#34;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig2.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.2 Cluster centers of MSA economic structure. The length of each colored bar represents the GDP percentage of the corresponding economic category.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the economic structure of cluster centers of low (Cluster I and II), medium (Cluster III, IV, and V), and high incidence level (Cluster VI, VII, and VIII) MSAs. It should be noted that a cluster center is calculated from the mean value of all the observations in the corresponding cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, Figure 2 shows the categories that demonstrate statistically significant difference among each cluster (i.e., difference from MSA averages), while all other categories with no significant difference among different clusters are combined into “Other categories.” Further, GDP categories are rearranged as follows: 1) management, administrative, and educational services are combined as “MAE service”; 2) information, finance/insurance, and professional services are combined as “high-end services”; and 3) the “Other categories” include construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation/food services, arts/entertainment/recreation, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 11 MSAs in critical COVID-19 incidence level with no significant clustering trends, so the clustering results from these 11 MSAs are not discussed in the economic clustering analysis below. For comparison, the average economic composition of all 380 MSAs is displayed as different sections in the stacked bar chart in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clusters&amp;rsquo; unique economic characteristics are summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of agriculture/forestry, Cluster V and VI have a higher percentage when compared to the MSA average level. Furthermore, one can also observe that the share of manufacturing of these two clusters is larger than the average level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the mining industry, Cluster II and IV have a higher proportion than the MSA average level. Similarly, the transportation/warehousing of these two clusters is also above the average level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for real estate/leasing, Cluster I and VIII have a higher share than the MSA average. Also, their percentage of public administration is greater than the MSA average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another noteworthy point is that Cluster III and VII have a higher percentage of high-end services and MAE services. The MSA average is shown by the last bar of the figure for easy comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-fig3-spatial-heterogeneity-in-ec-change-on-metropolitan-level-after-covid-19-a-total-ec-change-b-residential-ec-change&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig3.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.3 Spatial heterogeneity in EC change on metropolitan level after COVID-19. a. Total EC change. b. Residential EC change.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows the EC change in the U.S. on the metropolitan level after the pandemic began. The EC variation of MSAs are estimated and plot on the map. It shows the overall trend that total EC declined while residential EC increased, which is reasonable due to the implementation of the work-from-home model, although some regions experienced the opposite change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-fig4-total-ec-variation-among-different-clusters&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig4.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.4 Total EC variation among different clusters.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 shows the boxplot of total EC variation between April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 on the metropolitan level among different economic structure clusters. It clearly demonstrates an overall pattern of total EC reduction across all clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we connect Figure 4 and Figure 2 to build some connections between total EC reduction and economic structures, the following observations can be presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total EC change indicates that Clusters II and IV have significantly higher EC reduction than the average. Both of them have a sizable mining industry (about 7%) while other economic categories are similar to the MSA average, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, it can be inferred that MSAs with a high proportion of mining industry saw less EC reduction than other MSAs (i.e., mining industry EC is less affected during the pandemic), which is evidenced by a statistical difference in total EC reduction of II-and-IV versus other MSAs. This is reasonable, because the mining industry forms a significant portion of total electricity demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another significant observation is that both Clusters V and VI have a significantly higher proportion of agriculture/forestry and manufacturing than the MSA average, while their other economic categories are similar to the MSA average. The total EC of both clusters seem to have greater declines than the average level of total EC (i.e., the grey dashed line in Fig. 4), so this shows that agriculture/forestry and manufacturing tend to have more EC reduction during pandemic than other categories. Further observation is that the total EC of Cluster VI has less reduction than Cluster V, which can be possibly ascribed to higher mining industry share in Cluster VI than in Cluster V because mining industry EC is less affected during the pandemic, as discussed previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clusters III and VII share similar economic structure characteristics, with a concentration on intelligence-intensive services such as the economic category of high-end services (i.e., information, finance/insurance, professional services) and the category of MAE (i.e., management, administrative, and educational) services. However, the total EC of Clusters III-VII does not demonstrate statistically significant differences versus the total EC of other MSAs (Wilcoxon rank sum test:  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; =  0.3919,  &lt;em&gt;n1&lt;/em&gt; = 126,  &lt;em&gt;n2&lt;/em&gt; = 254,  &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; =  -0.8516). Thus, it can be statistically concluded that the load reduction in the high-end services and MAE services is aligned with average EC reduction. The possible reason is that although the computing loads of high-end and MAE services are shifted from offices to homes, and the residential home air conditioning loads stay at the same level before and after the pandemic, the air conditioning and lighting loads in commercial buildings should reduce considerably during the initial months of the pandemic. This makes the reduction pattern of high-end and MAE services similar to other economic categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Cluster I and VIII feature a disproportionately high share of the real estate/leasing and public administration industries in their economic structure, where the total EC reduction for the combination of Cluster I and VIII is statically less than in other clusters. It means that the real estate business and public administration categories tend to have less reduction in total EC than other categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the impacts of the pandemic, total EC changes among different incidence MSAs do not show an obvious pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, based on the observation, while there is an overall pattern of reduction in total EC across all clusters, the total EC variation is statistically related to economic structure during the initial months of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, economic structures more dependent on the mining industry exhibit significantly less EC reduction than other categories, and real estate/leasing and public administration industries also demonstrate less EC reduction after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, agriculture/forestry and manufacturing-dependent economic structures exhibit more EC reductions than other categories. Further, the EC reduction of intelligence-intensive services (e.g., high-end services, MAE services) is not significantly different from other categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig5.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig5&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.5 Residential EC variation among different clusters.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows the boxplot of residential EC variation between April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 at the metropolitan level among different economic structure clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It evidently demonstrates an overall pattern of residential EC increase across all clusters. The figure shows that the residential EC increase in Cluster IV is higher than the average level. However, no obvious reason can be concluded. Cluster VII and VIII are also well above the average level, but the difference is not statistically significant. The reason is that the small sizes of observations of Cluster VII and VIII result in statistical insignificance. Overall, the median values among other clusters were not significantly different, and the median values of residential EC increases of all clusters are around 7-10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, total EC variation during the initial months of COVID-19 is shown to be mainly related to economic structure, whereas residential EC is shown to have increased regardless of economic structure and COVID-19 incidence level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes an easy-to-implement and effective method for estimating EC change under a widely applied lockdown policy, and reveals the connections between EC change and economic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By considering the economic features of regions as they relate to potential pandemics or other social-economic crises as a set of new regulation rules or constraints, power grid administrators can improve energy resource planning and power grid operationsuch that the future power systems will be pandemic-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-personal-note&#34;&gt;A personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is an interdisciplinary work involving power, economy, and the emerging subject of data science. Although the intersection of different subjects might challenge the researchers, the new perspective can be inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With prosperous open-resource communities, many well-documented tools significantly reduce the cost of data analysis. In addition, the constantly increased open-access database, including many authorative data sources, boost the data availability notably. Given the enriched ore and handily spade, many subjects will have newblood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novelty in Science</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/novelty/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/novelty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I see reviewers regularly mistake complexity, difficulty, and technicality for novelty. In science reviewing, novelty seems to imply these things. We might be better served by removing the word “novelty” from the review instructions and replacing it with &lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauty removes the notions of “technical” and “complex” and gets more to the heart of scientific novelty. A painting can be beautiful even if it is simple and the technical complexity is low. So can a paper. A little squiggle of paint by Picasso can be as beautiful as an intricate painting by Rembrandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping beauty in mind, let’s look at some common reviewer misunderstandings about novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-complexity&#34;&gt;Novelty as complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of an idea is often confused with a lack of novelty when exactly the opposite is often true. A common review critique is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea is very simple. It just changes one term in the loss and everything else is the same as prior work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nobody thought to change that one term, then it is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ipso facto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; novel. The inventive insight is to realize that a small change could have a big effect and to formulate the new loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such reviews lead my students to say that we should make an idea appear more complex so that reviewers will find it of higher value. I value simplicity over unnecessary complexity; the simpler the better. Taking an existing network and replacing one thing is better science than concocting a whole new network just to make it look more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-difficulty&#34;&gt;Novelty as difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to get a paper into a top conference, therefore reviewers often feel that the ideas and technical details must be difficult. The authors have to shed blood, sweat, and tears to deserve a paper. Inexperienced reviewers, in particular, like to see that the authors have really worked hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formulating a simple idea means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core of something. This is one of the most useful things that a scientist can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple idea can be important. But it can also be trivial. This is where reviewers struggle. A trivial idea is an unimportant idea. If a paper has a simple idea that works better than the state of the art, then it is most likely not trivial. The authors are onto something and the field will be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-surprise&#34;&gt;Novelty as surprise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty and surprise are closely related. A novel idea is a surprising one by definition — it’s one that nobody in the field thought of. But there is a flip side to this as surprise is a fleeting emotion. If you hear a good idea, there is a moment of surprise and then, the better it is, the more obvious it may seem. A common review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea is obvious because the authors just combined two well known ideas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious is the opposite of novelty. So, if an idea is obvious &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve heard it, reviewers quickly assume it isn’t novel. The novelty, however, must be evaluated &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the idea existed. The inventive novelty was to have the idea in the first place. If it is easy to explain and obvious in hindsight, this in no way diminishes the creativity (and novelty) of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-technical-novelty&#34;&gt;Novelty as technical novelty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common misconception of reviewers is that novelty pertains to technical details. Novelty (and value) come in many forms in papers. A new dataset can be novel if it does something no other dataset has done, even if all the methods used to generate the dataset are well known. A new use of an old method can be novel if nobody ever thought to use it this way. Replacing a complex algorithm with a simple one provides insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty reveals itself in as many ways as beauty. Before critiquing a paper for a lack to technical novelty ask yourself if the true novelty lies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;novelty-as-usefulness-or-value&#34;&gt;Novelty as usefulness or value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all novel ideas are useful. Just the property of being new does not connote value. We want new ideas that lead us somewhere. Here, reviewers need to be very careful. It’s very hard to know where a new idea will take the field because any predictions that we make are based on the field as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common review I get is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors describe a new method but I don’t know why anyone needs this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of utility is indeed an issue but it is very hard to assess with a new idea. Reviewers should be careful here and aware that we all have limited imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-personal-note&#34;&gt;A personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My early career was built on seeing and formalizing connections between two established fields: robust statistics and Markov random fields. The novelty arose from the fact that nobody had put these ideas together before. It turned out to be a fertile space with many surprising connections that led to new theory. Fortunately, these connections also turned out to be valuable, resulting in practical algorithms that were state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hindsight, the connection between robust statistics and outliers in computer vision seems obvious. Today, the use of robust estimators in vision is the norm and seems no more novel than breathing air. But to see the connections for the first time, before others saw them, was like breathing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little in life more exciting than that spark of realization in science when you glimpse a new way of seeing. You feel as if you were the first to stand on a mountain peak. You are seeing the world for a moment the way nobody before you has ever seen it. This is novelty and it happens in an instant but is enabled by all of one’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting paper embodies the translation of the idea into code, experiments, and text. In this translation, the beauty of the spark may be only dimly glimpsed. My request of reviewers is to try to imagine the darkness before the spark.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Model Development Workflow in ADNES</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/andes_dev/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/andes_dev/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on my personal development experience, I summarized this guide as a clue for those who want to try ANDES and develop models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-andes&#34;&gt;What is ANDES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANDES&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source Python library for power system modeling and simulation developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cui.eecps.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Hantao Cui&lt;/a&gt;. ANDES allows users to develop new models by their own will, which can be easily done by translating block diagrams into models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of ANDES is introduced in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANDES is currently under &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; development and maintenance by Dr. Hantao Cui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-develop-new-model-with-andes&#34;&gt;How to develop new model with ANDES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples for development new models are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/modeling/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before developing a new model, it is recommended to go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.andes.app/en/stable/modelref.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Model reference&lt;/a&gt; and check out the existing groups and their functions. Then the following steps can be followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have installed ANDES in development mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check existing models that are similar to your model, and then draft the diagram of your model. Some standard model references are available on ESIG, Neplan, PowerWorld, and PSSE Model Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When implementing the model, similar function pieces from existing models can help to reduce manual efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your model and finalize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-generate the pycode by &lt;code&gt;andes prep&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes there occur multi-functionalities, where you may need &lt;code&gt;andes prep -f&lt;/code&gt; to re-generate all model codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a test case file that includes your model, where the IEEE 14-bus system and Kundur system can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the test case, and run the &lt;code&gt;ss.TDS.init()&lt;/code&gt; to see if the initialization is successful. If initialization runs into an error, you may need to tune the model initialization equations (&lt;code&gt;v_str&lt;/code&gt; defined in the model). Remember to run &lt;code&gt;andes prep&lt;/code&gt; and restart the kernel (for Jupyter Notebook users) every time you make a change to the model code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finishing the model development, it is encouraged to check the code style (can be done by package flake8) and open a PR to contribute it into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cuihantao/andes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ADNES repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Cyber-Physical Dynamic System (CPDS) Modeling for Frequency Regulation and AGC Services of Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/cpds/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/project/cpds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The substantial integration of renewable energy brings significant challenges to balance the system in real time because of the variability and intermittency of renewable power. For the reliable system operation, the frequency regulation service is used to stabilize the system frequency through automatically balancing the system generation and load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, with the substantially increasing deployment of renewable energy in electricity system, the requirement of frequency regulation (FR) services increases significantly. On the other hand, the current main resource of FR services, the controllable conventional generation, is continuously decreasing in the system generation mix. This means that in the future high renewable penetration power system, additional and alternative reliable FR services providers such as distributed energy storage (DES) resources should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the capability of utility-scale energy storage to provide FR services has been demonstrated, the integrated control and dynamic modeling of distributed energy resource (DER) providing frequency regulation grid services has been rarely explored. There are several challenges to adopt DERs to provide reliable grid services as illustrated in FERC 755.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the distributed installation of DES requires a comprehensive cyber-physical dynamic system (CPDS) modeling to fully consider the impacts of the communication latency variability on its real time FR provision capability. Unlike the conventional generators, there are two-layer communication between DERs and system operators which increase the communication delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, unlike the conventional generators whose dynamic models have been comprehensively studied, the difference among individual DER components&amp;rsquo; power-dynamic characteristic brings challenges in the accurate dynamic AGC modeling of its power-frequency relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the temporal dependent state of charge uncertainty of DERs challenges DERs&amp;rsquo; power and frequency regulation capacities scheduling in the look-ahead generation scheduling. Therefore, the aggregator should optimize the frequency regulation provision from individual DER in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, this project proposes a cyber-physical dynamic system (CPDS) model to handle the uncertainty of DERs two-layer communication latency and power dynamics. The variability of DERs&amp;rsquo; communication delay and dynamic constraints will be comprehensively modeled. The DERs&amp;rsquo; AGC model with communication delay is designed to validate DESs&amp;rsquo; frequency regulation services. Like current performance-based frequency regulation evaluation, the delivery of DERs&amp;rsquo; frequency regulation will be assessed through post-analysis of the actual AGC response with respect to the AGC control signal from system operators. Consequently, the reliability improvement with DERs providing reliable frequency regulation services can be evaluated from a comprehensive perspective considering all the dynamics of communication and power.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Large-scale Testbed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The electric power grid is undergoing unprecedented modernization toward higher reliability, higher efficiency, and lower cost through the integration of renewable energy, wide-area monitoring, and advanced control technology. This integration is making the transmission grid overwhelmingly complex to understand and model to apply new control or actuation technologies. This calls for a fast-prototyping platform for research and testing under the new transmission technology paradigm. Such a platform should be highly integrated, closed loop, and capable of mimicking a real power grid for testing new controls or algorithms. However, traditional software simulation packages usually perform specific tasks such as dynamic simulation or state estimation but lack the capability of providing an integrated closed-loop platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electricity Consumption Variation versus Economic Structure during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/covid/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/project/covid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in changes in productivity and daily life patterns, and as a result electricity consumption (EC) has also shifted. In this work, we construct estimates of EC changes at the metropolitan level across the continental U.S., including total EC and residential EC during the initial two months of the pandemic. The total and residential data on the state level were broken down into the county level, and then metropolitan level EC estimates were aggregated from the counties included in each metropolitan statistical area (MSA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work shows that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA, whereas regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S.. Since the MSAs account for 86% of the total population and 87% of the total EC of the continental U.S, the analytical result in this paper can provide important guidelines for future social-economic crises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harmonic Coupling Characteristics Analysis of Microgrid AC/DC Converter Based on HSS Modelling</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/hss/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/project/hss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A model of the AC/DC converter based on the harmonic state space (HSS) theory is developed, and the AC/DC harmonic coupling characteristics of the converter have been analyzed in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, through the mathematical derivation, the three-phase AC/DC converter is modeled based on the HSS theory. The HSS model includes each harmonic on the AC and DC sides, which reflects the relationship between the harmonic variables of each frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the harmonic transfer function of the converter is deduced by the model, and the diagram of harmonic coupling impedance is established to analyze the AC/DC harmonic coupling characteristics. The model is built according to the voltage source three-phase AC/DC converter which is commonly used in microgrids. The full range of coupling characteristics between AC and DC side is illustrated, and can be used to explore the harmonic characteristics at all frequencies, and can also be applied in harmonic analysis of converter with parallel and cascaded structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the simulation of the voltage source three-phase AC/DC converter is performed in PLECS, and it is compared with the HSS calculation results to verify the proposed model and the study of harmonic coupling characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the proposed model and the conclusion of harmonic coupling characteristics are verified by experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
