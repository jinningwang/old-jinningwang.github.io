    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the COVID-19 incidence map of the 380 MSAs in the continental U.S. during the two-month window from April to May 2020. The COVID-19 incidence of MSAs are calculated and plot on the map from U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sThe pandemic situation on the west coast (e.g., the states of Washington, Oregon, and California) was low to medium, and the situation along the southeastern coast (e.g., the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida) was medium. However, states along the northeastern coast were experiencing high-to-critical levels of COVID-19 incidence. The largest critical area was the MSA of New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA, which encompasses 20 million people. Along the northeastern coast, there were two other MSAs at critical incidence levels: Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ and Salisbury, MD-DE. The incidence level map shows geographical relevance among these areas since the adjacent MSAs to New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA also experienced a high incidence of COVID-19 at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Fig.2 Cluster centers of MSA economic structure. The length of each colored bar represents the GDP percentage of the corresponding economic category.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the economic structure of cluster centers of low (Cluster I and II), medium (Cluster III, IV, and V), and high incidence level (Cluster VI, VII, and VIII) MSAs. It should be noted that a cluster center is calculated from the mean value of all the observations in the corresponding cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, Figure 2 shows the categories that demonstrate statistically significant difference among each cluster (i.e., difference from MSA averages), while all other categories with no significant difference among different clusters are combined into “Other categories.” Further, GDP categories are rearranged as follows: 1) management, administrative, and educational services are combined as “MAE service”; 2) information, finance/insurance, and professional services are combined as “high-end services”; and 3) the “Other categories” include construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation/food services, arts/entertainment/recreation, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 11 MSAs in critical COVID-19 incidence level with no significant clustering trends, so the clustering results from these 11 MSAs are not discussed in the economic clustering analysis below. For comparison, the average economic composition of all 380 MSAs is displayed as different sections in the stacked bar chart in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clusters&amp;rsquo; unique economic characteristics are summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of agriculture/forestry, Cluster V and VI have a higher percentage when compared to the MSA average level. Furthermore, one can also observe that the share of manufacturing of these two clusters is larger than the average level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the mining industry, Cluster II and IV have a higher proportion than the MSA average level. Similarly, the transportation/warehousing of these two clusters is also above the average level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for real estate/leasing, Cluster I and VIII have a higher share than the MSA average. Also, their percentage of public administration is greater than the MSA average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another noteworthy point is that Cluster III and VII have a higher percentage of high-end services and MAE services. The MSA average is shown by the last bar of the figure for easy comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 shows the EC change in the U.S. on the metropolitan level after the pandemic began. The EC variation of MSAs are estimated and plot on the map. It shows the overall trend that total EC declined while residential EC increased, which is reasonable due to the implementation of the work-from-home model, although some regions experienced the opposite change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-total-ec-variation-among-different-clusters&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./image/Fig4.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Fig4&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Total EC variation among different clusters.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 shows the boxplot of total EC variation between April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 on the metropolitan level among different economic structure clusters. It clearly demonstrates an overall pattern of total EC reduction across all clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we connect Figure 4 and Figure 2 to build some connections between total EC reduction and economic structures, the following observations can be presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The total EC change indicates that Clusters II and IV have significantly higher EC reduction than the average. Both of them have a sizable mining industry (about 7%) while other economic categories are similar to the MSA average, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, it can be inferred that MSAs with a high proportion of mining industry saw less EC reduction than other MSAs (i.e., mining industry EC is less affected during the pandemic), which is evidenced by a statistical difference in total EC reduction of II-and-IV versus other MSAs. This is reasonable, because the mining industry forms a significant portion of total electricity demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another significant observation is that both Clusters V and VI have a significantly higher proportion of agriculture/forestry and manufacturing than the MSA average, while their other economic categories are similar to the MSA average. The total EC of both clusters seem to have greater declines than the average level of total EC (i.e., the grey dashed line in Fig. 4), so this shows that agriculture/forestry and manufacturing tend to have more EC reduction during pandemic than other categories. Further observation is that the total EC of Cluster VI has less reduction than Cluster V, which can be possibly ascribed to higher mining industry share in Cluster VI than in Cluster V because mining industry EC is less affected during the pandemic, as discussed previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clusters III and VII share similar economic structure characteristics, with a concentration on intelligence-intensive services such as the economic category of high-end services (i.e., information, finance/insurance, professional services) and the category of MAE (i.e., management, administrative, and educational) services. However, the total EC of Clusters III-VII does not demonstrate statistically significant differences versus the total EC of other MSAs (Wilcoxon rank sum test:  &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; =  0.3919,  &lt;em&gt;n1&lt;/em&gt; = 126,  &lt;em&gt;n2&lt;/em&gt; = 254,  &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; =  -0.8516). Thus, it can be statistically concluded that the load reduction in the high-end services and MAE services is aligned with average EC reduction. The possible reason is that although the computing loads of high-end and MAE services are shifted from offices to homes, and the residential home air conditioning loads stay at the same level before and after the pandemic, the air conditioning and lighting loads in commercial buildings should reduce considerably during the initial months of the pandemic. This makes the reduction pattern of high-end and MAE services similar to other economic categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Cluster I and VIII feature a disproportionately high share of the real estate/leasing and public administration industries in their economic structure, where the total EC reduction for the combination of Cluster I and VIII is statically less than in other clusters. It means that the real estate business and public administration categories tend to have less reduction in total EC than other categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the impacts of the pandemic, total EC changes among different incidence MSAs do not show an obvious pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, based on the observation, while there is an overall pattern of reduction in total EC across all clusters, the total EC variation is statistically related to economic structure during the initial months of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, economic structures more dependent on the mining industry exhibit significantly less EC reduction than other categories, and real estate/leasing and public administration industries also demonstrate less EC reduction after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, agriculture/forestry and manufacturing-dependent economic structures exhibit more EC reductions than other categories. Further, the EC reduction of intelligence-intensive services (e.g., high-end services, MAE services) is not significantly different from other categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Residential EC variation among different clusters.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows the boxplot of residential EC variation between April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 at the metropolitan level among different economic structure clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It evidently demonstrates an overall pattern of residential EC increase across all clusters. The figure shows that the residential EC increase in Cluster IV is higher than the average level. However, no obvious reason can be concluded. Cluster VII and VIII are also well above the average level, but the difference is not statistically significant. The reason is that the small sizes of observations of Cluster VII and VIII result in statistical insignificance. Overall, the median values among other clusters were not significantly different, and the median values of residential EC increases of all clusters are around 7-10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, total EC variation during the initial months of COVID-19 is shown to be mainly related to economic structure, whereas residential EC is shown to have increased regardless of economic structure and COVID-19 incidence level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes an easy-to-implement and effective method for estimating EC change under a widely applied lockdown policy, and
reveals the connections between EC change and economic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By considering the economic features of regions as they relate to potential pandemics or other social-economic crises as a set of new regulation rules or constraints, power grid administrators can improve energy resource planning and power grid operationsuch that the future power systems will be pandemic-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our EC change estimation method may potentially change the model of power grid constraints. A most recent example is the ongoing trend of incorporating of cyber-physical security (CPS) into power system operation and planning, in addition to classic physics-based security constraints. In other words, power grid constraint models may evolve from physics-only (conventional practices) to physics-and-CPS constraint models (as in some ongoing research works), and eventually to physics-CPS-and-pandemic all-inclusive constraint models (future studies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our estimates of EC variation at the U.S. metropolitan level reveal the impacts of a large-scale lockdown policy following the outbreak of COVID-19 on both total EC and residential sector EC. Our estimates also show how EC variation is affected by the economic structure of different MSAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on in-depth analysis of economic structures, we have found that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA. High percentage shares in the mining industry and real estate/leasing are related to smaller decreases in total EC, whereas a large reduction in total EC is related to a high share of manufacturing.
In contrast, regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly, the increase in residential consumption was brought by the shelter-in-place orders issued during the April-May 2020 time period. Following the pandemic, some organizations may allow employees to work from home permanently, indicating that the pandemic may affect people&amp;rsquo;s lifestyles and society over a longer time scale than the temporary lockdown time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a possible result, variations in both total and residential sector EC caused by the pandemic may never completely return to pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electricity Consumption Variation versus Economic Structure during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/covid/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in changes in productivity and daily life patterns, and as a result electricity consumption (EC) has also shifted. In this work, we construct estimates of EC changes at the metropolitan level across the continental U.S., including total EC and residential EC during the initial two months of the pandemic. The total and residential data on the state level were broken down into the county level, and then metropolitan level EC estimates were aggregated from the counties included in each metropolitan statistical area (MSA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work shows that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA, whereas regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S.. Since the MSAs account for 86% of the total population and 87% of the total EC of the continental U.S, the analytical result in this paper can provide important guidelines for future social-economic crises.&lt;/p&gt;
