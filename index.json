COVID-19 Incidence map of 380 metropolitan statistical areas in the continental U.S. during April-May 2020. Figure 1 shows the COVID-19 incidence map of the 380 MSAs in the continental U.S. during the two-month window from April to May 2020. The COVID-19 incidence of MSAs are calculated and plot on the map from U.S. Census Bureau.\nsThe pandemic situation on the west coast (e.g., the states of Washington, Oregon, and California) was low to medium, and the situation along the southeastern coast (e.g., the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida) was medium. However, states along the northeastern coast were experiencing high-to-critical levels of COVID-19 incidence. The largest critical area was the MSA of New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA, which encompasses 20 million people. Along the northeastern coast, there were two other MSAs at critical incidence levels: Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ and Salisbury, MD-DE. The incidence level map shows geographical relevance among these areas since the adjacent MSAs to New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA also experienced a high incidence of COVID-19 at this time.\nFig.2 Cluster centers of MSA economic structure. The length of each colored bar represents the GDP percentage of the corresponding economic category. Figure 2 shows the economic structure of cluster centers of low (Cluster I and II), medium (Cluster III, IV, and V), and high incidence level (Cluster VI, VII, and VIII) MSAs. It should be noted that a cluster center is calculated from the mean value of all the observations in the corresponding cluster.\nFor simplicity, Figure 2 shows the categories that demonstrate statistically significant difference among each cluster (i.e., difference from MSA averages), while all other categories with no significant difference among different clusters are combined into “Other categories.” Further, GDP categories are rearranged as follows: 1) management, administrative, and educational services are combined as “MAE service”; 2) information, finance/insurance, and professional services are combined as “high-end services”; and 3) the “Other categories” include construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation/food services, arts/entertainment/recreation, and other services.\nThere are 11 MSAs in critical COVID-19 incidence level with no significant clustering trends, so the clustering results from these 11 MSAs are not discussed in the economic clustering analysis below. For comparison, the average economic composition of all 380 MSAs is displayed as different sections in the stacked bar chart in Figure 2.\nThe clusters’ unique economic characteristics are summarized as follows:\nIn terms of agriculture/forestry, Cluster V and VI have a higher percentage when compared to the MSA average level. Furthermore, one can also observe that the share of manufacturing of these two clusters is larger than the average level. Regarding the mining industry, Cluster II and IV have a higher proportion than the MSA average level. Similarly, the transportation/warehousing of these two clusters is also above the average level. As for real estate/leasing, Cluster I and VIII have a higher share than the MSA average. Also, their percentage of public administration is greater than the MSA average. Another noteworthy point is that Cluster III and VII have a higher percentage of high-end services and MAE services. The MSA average is shown by the last bar of the figure for easy comparison. Fig.3 Spatial heterogeneity in EC change on metropolitan level after COVID-19. a. Total EC change. b. Residential EC change. Figure 3 shows the EC change in the U.S. on the metropolitan level after the pandemic began. The EC variation of MSAs are estimated and plot on the map. It shows the overall trend that total EC declined while residential EC increased, which is reasonable due to the implementation of the work-from-home model, although some regions experienced the opposite change.\nTotal EC variation among different clusters. Figure 4 shows the boxplot of total EC variation between April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 on the metropolitan level among different economic structure clusters. It clearly demonstrates an overall pattern of total EC reduction across all clusters.\nIf we connect Figure 4 and Figure 2 to build some connections between total EC reduction and economic structures, the following observations can be presented.\nThe total EC change indicates that Clusters II and IV have significantly higher EC reduction than the average. Both of them have a sizable mining industry (about 7%) while other economic categories are similar to the MSA average, as shown in Figure 2. Thus, it can be inferred that MSAs with a high proportion of mining industry saw less EC reduction than other MSAs (i.e., mining industry EC is less affected during the pandemic), which is evidenced by a statistical difference in total EC reduction of II-and-IV versus other MSAs.

In science reviewing, novelty seems to imply these things. We might be better served by removing the word “novelty” from the review instructions and replacing it with beauty.\nBeauty removes the notions of “technical” and “complex” and gets more to the heart of scientific novelty. A painting can be beautiful even if it is simple and the technical complexity is low. So can a paper. A little squiggle of paint by Picasso can be as beautiful as an intricate painting by Rembrandt.\nKeeping beauty in mind, let’s look at some common reviewer misunderstandings about novelty.\nNovelty as complexity The simplicity of an idea is often confused with a lack of novelty when exactly the opposite is often true. A common review critique is\nThe idea is very simple. It just changes one term in the loss and everything else is the same as prior work.\nIf nobody thought to change that one term, then it is ipso facto novel. The inventive insight is to realize that a small change could have a big effect and to formulate the new loss.\nSuch reviews lead my students to say that we should make an idea appear more complex so that reviewers will find it of higher value. I value simplicity over unnecessary complexity; the simpler the better. Taking an existing network and replacing one thing is better science than concocting a whole new network just to make it look more complex.\nNovelty as difficulty It’s hard to get a paper into a top conference, therefore reviewers often feel that the ideas and technical details must be difficult. The authors have to shed blood, sweat, and tears to deserve a paper. Inexperienced reviewers, in particular, like to see that the authors have really worked hard.\nFormulating a simple idea means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core of something. This is one of the most useful things that a scientist can do.\nA simple idea can be important. But it can also be trivial. This is where reviewers struggle. A trivial idea is an unimportant idea. If a paper has a simple idea that works better than the state of the art, then it is most likely not trivial. The authors are onto something and the field will be interested.\nNovelty as surprise Novelty and surprise are closely related. A novel idea is a surprising one by definition — it’s one that nobody in the field thought of. But there is a flip side to this as surprise is a fleeting emotion. If you hear a good idea, there is a moment of surprise and then, the better it is, the more obvious it may seem. A common review:\nThe idea is obvious because the authors just combined two well known ideas.\nObvious is the opposite of novelty. So, if an idea is obvious after you’ve heard it, reviewers quickly assume it isn’t novel. The novelty, however, must be evaluated before the idea existed. The inventive novelty was to have the idea in the first place. If it is easy to explain and obvious in hindsight, this in no way diminishes the creativity (and novelty) of the idea.\nNovelty as technical novelty The most common misconception of reviewers is that novelty pertains to technical details. Novelty (and value) come in many forms in papers. A new dataset can be novel if it does something no other dataset has done, even if all the methods used to generate the dataset are well known. A new use of an old method can be novel if nobody ever thought to use it this way. Replacing a complex algorithm with a simple one provides insight.\nNovelty reveals itself in as many ways as beauty. Before critiquing a paper for a lack to technical novelty ask yourself if the true novelty lies elsewhere.\nNovelty as usefulness or value Not all novel ideas are useful. Just the property of being new does not connote value. We want new ideas that lead us somewhere. Here, reviewers need to be very careful. It’s very hard to know where a new idea will take the field because any predictions that we make are based on the field as it is today.\nA common review I get is\nThe authors describe a new method but I don’t know why anyone needs this.\nLack of utility is indeed an issue but it is very hard to assess with a new idea. Reviewers should be careful here and aware that we all have limited imagination.\nA personal note My early career was built on seeing and formalizing connections between two established fields: robust statistics and Markov random fields. The novelty arose from the fact that nobody had put these ideas together before. It turned out to be a fertile space with many surprising connections that led to new theory. Fortunately, these connections also turned out to be valuable, resulting in practical algorithms that were state of the art.\nWith hindsight, the connection between robust statistics and outliers in computer vision seems obvious. Today, the use of robust estimators in vision is the norm and seems no more novel than breathing air. But to see the connections for the first time, before others saw them, was …","date":1643500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668297600,"objectID":"b47b51d05d0051ac7771dab069be18c8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/shared/","publishdate":"2022-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/shared/","section":"post","summary":"Reviewers have strong ideas about what makes a paper acceptable in top conferences like CVPR.

In this work, we construct estimates of EC changes at the metropolitan level across the continental U.S., including total EC and residential EC during the initial two months of the pandemic. The total and residential data on the state level were broken down into the county level, and then metropolitan level EC estimates were aggregated from the counties included in each metropolitan statistical area (MSA).\nThis work shows that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA, whereas regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S.. Since the MSAs account for 86% of the total population and 87% of the total EC of the continental U.S, the analytical result in this paper can provide important guidelines for future social-economic crises.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"870136a6e662403b3888b60d8524d825","permalink":"https://example.com/project/covid/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid/","section":"project","summary":"This work shows that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA, whereas regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S..","tags":["Data Mining","Electricity Consumption","Economic Structure"],"title":"Electricity Consumption Variation versus Economic Structure during COVID-19","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The electric power grid is undergoing unprecedented modernization toward higher reliability, higher efficiency, and lower cost through the integration of renewable energy, wide-area monitoring, and advanced control technology.

Such a platform should be highly integrated, closed loop, and capable of mimicking a real power grid for testing new controls or algorithms.
